/**
 * Test.java
 *
 * Code Description: Description of each error follows
 * 
 * A). test2 is undefined, because it does not have a file.
 * B). Only the text output changes, for the word 'Emergency' is just an output and therefore not case sensitive.
 * C). It says that every word that was in the string cannot be resolved to a type and everything after the second quotation
 * 	   will be part of a string.
 * D). It says the string is missing a quotation, for the string is never ended and the rest of the line is considered part
 * 	   of the string.
 * E). The console outputs nothing, but the code throws no errors.
 * F). The error is "The method bogus(String) is undefined for the type PrintStream", meaning that bogus is not a method for System.out
 * G). Says syntax error, must have semicolon to end statement
 * H). Syntax error, must insert } into the program
